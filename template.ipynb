    "\n",
    "HTTP is a protocol for fethcing resources like HTML documents, images, video, ads (yuck), and other content that make up a web page.  HTTP is a client-server protocol meaning that the client, usually a web browser, initiates a request and the server(s) sends a response.  This is where the python package `requests` gets its name, from the request piece of the request/response exchange.\n",
