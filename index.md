# Web Scraping in Python

Web scraping is a technique used to collect information from the internet and save it so it can be analyzed as needed. This course will walk you through using several different strategies and several different python libraries to scrape data from the web and analyze it.  

The content on the web is incredibly diverse, so web scraping scripts are usually custom built to target specific web sites and data.  These example projects will get you familiar with the various process and possibilities of web scraping so you can begin building a custom web scraper to target the web sites and information you are interested in.  

If you are new to using Constellate, python and jupyter notebooks, I recommend taking Constellate's <a href ="https://ithaka.github.io/constellate-python-basics/">Python Basics course before proceeding.  </a> 


## Project #1: Getting Started with Web Scraping

This first project will use the `requests` package to introduce the basic web scraping workflow.  
    1. Send a request to a web server.
    2. Check for a response.
    3. View the content of that response.
    4. Save that content to a file.
