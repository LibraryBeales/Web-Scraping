# Web Scraping in Python

Web scraping is a technique used to collect information from the internet and save it so it can be analyzed as needed. This course will walk you through using several different strategies and several different python libraries to scrape data from the web and analyze it.  

The content on the web is incredibly diverse, so web scraping scripts are usually custom built to target specific web sites and data.  These example projects will get you familiar with the various process and possibilities of web scraping so you can begin building a custom web scraper to target the web sites and information you are interested in.  

If you are new to using Constellate, python and jupyter notebooks, I recommend taking Constellate's <a href ="https://ithaka.github.io/constellate-python-basics/">Python Basics course before proceeding.  </a> 

## Why web scrape?

The content on the web is an unbelievably rich resource.  However, the information available can be difficult to collect and organize manually.  Additionally, the content on the web is constantly changing.  If you are basing your research on information from the web, it would be a good idea to store that infomation somewhere yourself, so that those who are evaluating your research can access that information as well.

For example, if you were interested in analyzing how people communicate on social media about the NASDAQ, you could manually search for posts tagged with #NASDAQ, copy and paste them or screen shot them, and then begin manually organizing the user names, likes, tags, text content, etc.  You would be limited in the sample size you could analyze by the amount of labor required.

If, however, you built a web scraper to crawl a site and capture every post with a #NASDAQ tag, you'd be able to capture a much larger sample size and save the data in an acccessible format for future researchers.  Analysis of that data, also using python, would allow you to quickly see who posts the most, which posts have the most likes, what stock tickers are mentioned most frequestly in a given time span, etc.  

In short, web scraping makes the endless data available online accessible and useful. 




## Project #1: Making an HTTP Request and Receiving a Response

This first project will use the `requests` package to introduce the basic web scraping workflow.  

In this project you will:
1. Send a request to a web server.
2. Check for a response.
3. View the content of that response.
4. Save that content to a file.

## Project #2: Exploring and Analyzing Data from Web Scraping 

This second project will explore the data we have saved from the first project.

1. Send a request to a web server.
2. Check for a response.
3. View the content of that response.
4. Save that content to a file.

## Project #5: What's next?  Scraping other pages.

In this project you will:
1. Begin with a new web page.
2. Choose info to scrape.
3. Build a web scraper specifically for this site and this info.
4. Save that content to a file.
